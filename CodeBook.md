## Code Book

This section contains specific information each variable (column) included in the uploaded table, HAR-subject-activity-mean.txt.  Most of the variables are summarizations of variables with the same name and description in the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).  The variables are described in the `features_info.txt` and `README.txt` in that dataset.  Please see those files for more details.  

Units (according to the `README.txt` file):

- For all accelerometer-related variables (containing the word "Acc" in the variable name), the units are in standard gravity units 'g'.
- For all gyroscope-related variables (containing the word "Gyro" in the variable name), the units are radians/second.

Quoting from `features_info.txt`, here is an additional description of the variables:

> The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filt er with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
> 
> Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
> 
> Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
> 
> These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
